# This is just a text :clap:

I've created this repository just to test my newest skills using git, MD and html.

**Someone** once said 
>knowledge without application is useless.

what a learned from git

* git status
* git push
* git pull
* git commit -m "message" or git commit -am "message" to commit all the files
* git add <file name>  /*used to _track_ my files */
 
 and several more comands.
