# This is just a text :clap:

I've created this repository just to test my newest skills using git, MD and html.

**Someone** once said 
>knowledge without application is useless.

what a learned from git

* git status
* git push
* git pull
* git commit -m "message" or git commit -am "message" to commit all the files
* git add <file name>  /*used to _track_ my files */
* git log -> witch tells me my commit
* git reset -> to returne to an expecific commit
* git reset --hard <commit> (the numeber of the commit, can get with git log)
* git reset --hard origin/master (to get my current version on my remote repository )
* git branch -> tells me what branch I'm working on it and shows me the available branchs
* git checkout -b style -> changes to a new branch called style
* git checkout <name of the branch> --> to change between branches
 
 and several more comands.
