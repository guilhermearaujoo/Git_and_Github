* git add <file name>  /*used to _track_ my files */
* git log -> witch tells me my commit
* git reset -> to returne to an expecific commit
* git reset --hard <commit> (the numeber of the commit, can get with git log)
* git reset --hard origin/master (to get my current version on my remote repository )
